# SSH-Enumeration

Just a simple SSH user enumeration script I created today as part of the HackTheBox machine I'm currently rooting.
Tested against an OpenSSH 7.9 server with no issues; as this script was more for personal use I haven't tested it thoroughly.

It's nothing special; it served me well (it did what I wanted it to do, anyhow!)

Python pwntools is a minimum requirement for running this script.

Hope you enjoy my noobery ^-^
